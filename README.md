Solutions to the coding challenges given out on application for a job at
ThoughtWorks.

They seem a OOP/Java/C++ shop, and I don't really feel like writing verbose,
cumbersome, inflexible OOP Java style code, especially when these challenges can
be elegantly met in a functional style using the module/function rather
then the object/method 'pattern'.

See the 'src' folder, the rest is boilerplate so that I can easily visualize
things in a browser if I need/want to.
