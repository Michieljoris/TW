Add these functions to a controller:

	navigator.id.logout();

    };

    $scope.signin = function($event) {

	navigator.id.request();
    };

Have this html snippet in the controller's scope somewhere:    
     <div ng-show="true">
       <a ng-hide="signedIn" href="#" class="persona-button blue" ng-click="signin($event)"><span>Sign in</span></a>
       <a ng-show="signedIn" href="#" class="persona-button blue" ng-click="signout($event)"><span>Sign out</span></a>
     </div>

    }
Add the right emails to authorized_emails.js

    [
	'michieljoris@gmail.com'
    ];

Add this to server.js
,signin = require("./signin.js")
,signout = require("./signout.js")
Add this to the post handlers
	,"/signin": signin
	,"/signout": signout
After successfull signin $scope.signedIn is the user's email address

  PROBLEM ONE : SALES TAXES
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food,
and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax
applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.

When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items
and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items,
and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.  The rounding rules for sales tax are
that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to
the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.

Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets...
