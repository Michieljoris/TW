Solutions of tasks you apparently need to do when applying for a job at ThoughtWorks.

To try Conway Game of Life, clone the repo and then in the repo's directory:
: npm install
: bin/build
: bin/serve

Open browser at http://localhost:9001

Set cell size, grid size/weight and use the mouse to click and drag to turn
cells on. 

Click Save to store a world. Click Re- and call to restore and cycle to saved
worlds.

Go and step to generate next generations.

Clear to clear the grid :-p

Delete to clear the saved world registers.

It iterates quite quickly and is nice to look at, since I added colors.

Rest of the solutions are in the src folder as node js files. Just execute them
and see the results.
